# My-personal-roadmap-for-2023
 A repository that organizes together everything that has ever been produced in all the others as a learning tree


This tree was originally created by the :<br>
[ErdemOzgen/Data-Engineering-Roadmap ](https://github.com/ErdemOzgen/Data-Engineering-Roadmap)<br>
I ended up making some modifications and adding other images:


# Skill tree and study guide for 2023

# Comments

this tree does not fully reflect all the knowledge I have acquired, just a guide to what has already been done in relation to the road-map of a data engineer.

Several other projects were developed in private repositories.

# C# and .Net

3- [Envolvable-web-APIs](https://github.com/MatheusAraujoSouza/Envolvable-web-APIs)<br>

much of what was developed in .NET is in private research repositories and corporate projects
